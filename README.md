Brap brap brap i am updating this after 2 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WAHHGOOOOO!!!!

To mute channels in the visualizer, use 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, q, w, e, r, t, y, u. 
Corresponds to channels 1-16!!! 
Better way of doing this: Make the channels mutable by clicking a button
I don't know how to make click objects in C# sorry

Now with 100% more illegal bass.net.dll distribution
